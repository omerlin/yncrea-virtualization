The course takes place over three days and intends to give students an understanding of virtualization technologies:
- OS virtualization & automation (concepts, virtualbox, vagrant)
- containers (Docker)
- micro-services orchestrators (Kubernetes).

The aim is to give knowledge around technologies integrations, networking flows and a taste of what these technologies afford.
At the end of the training, students will be evaluated by:
- deploying a simple kubernetes application 
- and answering to a quizz around concepts seen during the training.
