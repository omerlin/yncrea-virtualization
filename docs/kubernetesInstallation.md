# Kubernetes installation
## Introduction

Kubernetes can be installed in many ways. 
We will concentrate here on Private Homer Office installation.
As this is an incredibly changing world, we are testing some tools having in mind following KISS principle even for production ready cluster.  

| **Method**  | **Scope / Usage** |  Alternative   |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `minikube`  | Dev environment   | [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/) or kubeadm |
| `k3s`       | Edge computing, ARM | microk8s also |
| `rke`       | Production cluster | [kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/) |
 
!!! warning
    After many test, it seems to me better and more reliable to rely on K3s for our hands-on
    ==minikube== is also a good choice ... but experimented bad/strange behavior on my Windows 7 laptop

## Checking installation

## K3S from Rancher

Quick Installation and architecture is here: [Lightweight Kubernetes](https://k3s.io/)
Reference documentation is here: [Reference K3S documentation](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/)

### Installation on our Vagrant environment

!!! note
    we increased the number of core=2 and memory=2048m on worker1

```
VBoxManage snapshot worker1 restore snap-worker1-initial
VBoxManage startvm worker1 --type headless
VBoxManage startvm worker2 --type headless
```

Then `ssh worker1`:
```
vagrant@box1:~$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

vagrant@box1:~$ sudo k3s kubectl get node

```
To get rights as vagrant user:
```
vagrant@box1:~$ export KUBECONFIG="/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml"
vagrant@box1:~$ sudo chmod o+r /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
vagrant@box1:~$ kubectl get pods -A

```

!!! note
    This install is really light as it doesn't use Docker at all but only containerd 

!!! warning
    There is currently an issue to create an agent - and so create a k3scluster
    So we will work on a standalone node.

## RKE from Rancher

==RKE== is to deploy efficiently a production Kubernetes cluster.

### Installation

```
curl -LO https://github.com/rancher/rke/releases/download/v1.0.16/rke_linux-amd64
sudo cp rke_linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/rke
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rke
```
Then we have to manage the SSH communication with other nodes
```
ssh-keygen
```
Then we install the d_rsa.pub in the vagrant@worker2;/home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

!!! note
    Normally all these operations are done automatically with an automation tool like `ansible`
    It's important to check manually ssh connectivity


We create the cluster configuration file: cluster.yml
```
ssh_key_path: "/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa"
ssh_cert_path: ""
ssh_agent_auth: false
nodes:
- address: "10.0.3.6"
  role:
    - controlplane
    - etcd
    - worker
  user: "vagrant"
- address: "10.0.3.7"
  role:
    - worker
  user: "vagrant"
```
!!! tip
    probably it would be better to add the worker1 as a worker too ... to not spoil resources

Then it's almost finished:
```
rke up
```
This can take a long time if your network is slow ... as it will download ~2Gb of data
If everything is fine, you need just to configure `kubectl`
```
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
cp kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubectl
export KUBECONFIG="/home/vagrant/kube_config_cluster.yml"
vagrant@box1:~$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"20", GitVersion:"v1.20.2", GitCommit:"faecb196815e248d3ecfb03c680a4507229c2a56", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-13T13:28:09Z", GoVersion:"go1.15.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17", GitVersion:"v1.17.17", GitCommit:"f3abc15296f3a3f54e4ee42e830c61047b13895f", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2021-01-13T13:13:00Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.15", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}
```
You are done !

```
vagrant@box1:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES               AGE   VERSION
10.0.3.6   Ready    controlplane,etcd   29m   v1.17.17
10.0.3.7   Ready    worker              29m   v1.17.17
```


## Minikube

Installation link: [Minikube installation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/)

##  (Minikube) Windows Installation

### Requirements
You need virtualbox or Hyper-v

### Installation

On Windows, from ==an elevated command shell== :
```
choco install minikube

minikube start
```

!!! info ""
    The download ISO for minikube is around 170 Mb

!!! info
    Kubectl (kubernetes client) installation ==no more needed==, as this comes with minikube installation
    ```
    choco install kubernetes-cli 
    ```

Of course, you may need to upgrade a previous installation:
```
choco upgrade minikube -y
```

### Recovery procedure

!!! warning
    `For Windows`
    This procedure allows recovering to a sane environment and replay installation
  

```
minikube stop
choco uninstall minikube;kubernetes-cli
```

* Go to your USER home directory
* Delete ALL files under subdirectory `.minikube`
* Delete All files under subdirectory `.kube`
* (Optional) set your company proxy
* Install minikube
```
choco install minikube
```

* {--Put minikube.exe and kubectl.exe in your windows PATH--}
* (Optional) set your company proxy
* minikube start
* Test with kubectl:
```
kubectl get nodes 
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    master   1m    v1.10.0
```

!!! warning
    We have an installed version 1.10.0 because we are ==not based on Windows 10 and Docker for Windows==
    So we suggest in that case to move to Linux installation
