In combination, these techniques ran much faster than previous emulators and helped define x86 virtualization as we know it today, including the old mainframe concept of the “hypervisor” – a platform upon which IT could create and run virtual machines. For years, VMware and its patents ruled the realm of virtualization. On the server side, running on bare metal, VMware's ESX became the leading Type 1 (or native) hypervisor. On the client side, running within an existing desktop operating system, VMware Workstation was among the top Type 2 (or hosted) hypervisors. | ![TIMELINE2](./files/virtualization/timeline_virtualization2.png "Timeline part2")
